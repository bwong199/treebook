A facebook clone built using the tutorial on Teamtreehouse.com - https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-simple-ruby-on-rails-application. 

The tutorial used Rails 3 and some outdated gems, but I built it using Rails 4 and current gems. 

Key features include: 

	- Registration & authentication
	- Find friends
	- Send/accept/decline friend requests
	- Create status feeds
	- Status feeds only show feeds from self and requested friends
	- Upload pictures to album
	- Activities feed
